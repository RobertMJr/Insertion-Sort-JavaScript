# Insertion Sort Algorithm [![](https://img.shields.io/badge/Robert-Muraru-blue)](https://robert-muraru-portfolio.herokuapp.com/)


## Description
A sorting algorithm is an algorithm made up of a series of instructions that takes an array as input. It performs specified operations on the array, sometimes called a list, and outputs a sorted array.
 Efficient sorting is important for optimizing the use of other algorithms (such as search and merge algorithms) which require input data to be in sorted lists.

### [Insertion Sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insertion_sort)
* Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array (or list) one item at a time.
* Insertion sort iterates, consuming one input element each repetition, and grows a sorted output list. At each iteration, insertion sort removes one element from the input data, finds the location it belongs within the sorted list, and inserts it there. It repeats until no input elements remain.
